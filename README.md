# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
This repository is focused on the Requirement Analysis phase of software development. It is part of a hands-on project where I‚Äôll be analyzing and documenting the requirements for a booking management system. The main goal here is to break down the foundation of a software project before any code is written, identifying what the system needs to do, who will use it, and how it should behave. This is a key step in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and sets the stage for building reliable, user-focused solutions. Throughout this project, I‚Äôll be applying real-world methods and tools like structured documentation, use case analysis, diagrams (via Draw.io), and acceptance criteria, all to ensure clarity, alignment, and a solid blueprint for development.

# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is one of the most critical phases in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It involves gathering, analyzing, validating, and documenting what a software system should do before development begins. In simple terms, it‚Äôs about understanding the problem before building the solution.

## üîç Why It Matters in the SDLC
Every successful project starts with a clear understanding of what needs to be built. Here‚Äôs why requirement analysis is so important:

1. **Clarity and Alignment**  
   It ensures that everyone such as the developers, designers, testers, clients, and stakeholders, are all on the same page. This avoids confusion, feature creep, and misaligned expectations later in the process.

2. **Guides Design and Development**  
   Clear requirements act as a roadmap. They influence architecture, UI/UX design, database structure, and even technology choices. Without it, teams risk building the wrong thing or missing out on key functionality.

3. **Reduces Rework and Saves Cost**  
   Fixing mistakes during the coding or deployment phase is far more expensive than addressing them during the planning phase. Requirement analysis helps catch problems early.

4. **Improves Testing and Validation**  
   Well-defined requirements make it easier to write meaningful test cases and validate that the final product meets user needs.

5. **Supports Agile or Traditional Workflows**  
   Whether you're working in Agile sprints or a more traditional waterfall model, requirement analysis feeds into backlog creation, task estimation, and prioritization.
