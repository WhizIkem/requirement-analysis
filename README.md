# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
This repository is focused on the Requirement Analysis phase of software development. It is part of a hands-on project where I’ll be analyzing and documenting the requirements for a booking management system. The main goal here is to break down the foundation of a software project before any code is written — identifying what the system needs to do, who will use it, and how it should behave. This is a key step in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and sets the stage for building reliable, user-focused solutions. Throughout this project, I’ll be applying real-world methods and tools like structured documentation, use case analysis, diagrams (via Draw.io), and acceptance criteria — all to ensure clarity, alignment, and a solid blueprint for development.
